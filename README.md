Target breach happened because of a basic network segmentation error.

Nov. 15 and Dec. 15, 2013

Hackers gained access to Target POS systems using login credentials belonging to an HVAC company.

Type of attack Phishing.

The massive data breach at Target last month may have resulted partly from the retailer's failure to properly segregate systems handling sensitive payment card data from the rest of its network.
Hackers broke into the retailer's network using login credentials stolen from a heating, ventilation and air conditioning company that does work for Target at a number of locations.

Attackers first gained access to Target's network on Nov. 15, 2013 with a username and password stolen from Fazio Mechanical Services, a Sharpsburg, Pa.-based company that specializes in providing refrigeration and HVAC systems for companies like Target.

Fazio apparently had access rights to Target's network for carrying out tasks like remotely monitoring energy consumption and temperatures at various stores.
The attackers leveraged the access provided by the Fazio credentials to move about undetected on Target's network and upload malware programs on the company's Point of Sale (POS) systems.

The hackers first tested the data-stealing malware on a small number of cash registers and then, after determining that the software worked, uploaded it to a majority of Target's POS systems. Between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15, 2013, the attackers used the malware to steal data on about 40 million debit and credit cards. U.S., Brazil and Russia.

Ever since Target first disclosed the data breach in December, the company has portrayed itself as the victim of an especially sophisticated cyber heist. Indeed, in testimony before Congress this week, Target executives defended the company's security practices and maintained that the breach was hard to avoid because of its sophisticated nature.

Jody Brazil, founder and CTO at security vendor FireMon. "There's nothing fancy about the breach," Brazil said.
"Target chose to allow a third party access to its network," but failed to properly secure that access, Brazil said.
Even if Target had a valid reason for giving Fazio access, the retailer should have segmented its network to ensure that Fazio and other third parties had no access to its payment systems.

Several mature processes and practices currently exist for securing third-party access to enterprise networks, Brazil said. Even the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which companies like Target are required to follow, specifies network segmentation as a way to protect sensitive cardholder data.

It was Target's responsibility to ensure that those practices were followed, Brazil said. But the fact that attackers were apparently able to leverage their third-party access to reach Target's payment systems suggests those practices were improperly implemented -- at best.

The only really sophisticated component of the attack appears to have been the malware used to intercept and steal payment card data from Target's POS systems. But the attackers would have been unable to install the malware if Target had employed proper network segmentation practices in the first place, Brazil said.

Stephen Boyer, CTO and co-founder of BitSight, a company that specializes in third-party risk management, said the breach highlights the threat posed to companies by network-connected outsiders.

January 2023: T-Mobile Discloses Data Breach .

T-Mobile CEO says hacker used ‘brute force’ attacks to breach IT servers.

The breach involved the theft of personal information for more than 54 million people, including social security numbers, names, phone numbers and addresses for some, but not financial info. Device identifiers and PINs were obtained for certain accounts. Current, former and prospective T-Mobile customers were among those with personal data stolen. Business customers also had information taken.

That breach came to light after a hacker began selling the records on a cybercrime forum. Last year, T-Mobile agreed to pay $500 million to settle all class action lawsuits stemming from the 2021 breach. The company pledged to spend $150 million of that money toward beefing up its own cybersecurity.Jan 19, 2023

According to the dark web forum, hackers claim to have personal information from 100 million T-Mobile customers, including names, phone numbers, home addresses, and more sensitive data like social security numbers, driver’s license information, and IMEI numbers (unique identifiers tied to each mobile device).
According to Motherboard who first reported the breach on Sunday, hackers are already selling a portion of the 100 million T-Mobile customers’ data for 6 bitcoin, about $280,000. Motherboard confirmed the sample and said it is accurate information.
Customers and victims of this data breach could face a whole host of attacks such as phishing through email or SMS text messages, scam phone calls, along with SIM card swapping where the user’s phone number is taken over, and they can no longer use their account. Hackers could also use customer phone’s to access other accounts by intercepting text messages for authentication.

Preventing a breach of your network and its systems requires protection against a variety of cyber attacks. For each attack, the appropriate countermeasure must be deployed/used to deter it from exploiting a vulnerability or weakness.
